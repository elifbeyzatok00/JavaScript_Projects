# Kelven Weather 

Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin">Kelvin</a> has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. 
However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.
With my knowledge of JavaScript, converted Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.

For example, 283 K converts to 10 °C which converts to 50 °F.


# Newton Scale

I converted celsius to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_scale">Newton</a> Scale using the equation below

Newton = Celsius * (33/100)
